# PROJECT 1: OVERVIEW

### Structuring of Projects:
Multiple repositories will be created, each project will have its own repository. All repository will be linked under one Kanban project so the progress of each project can be tracked easily.

- Project 1 (Agile & Scrum Implementation): This repository  
- Project 2 (Web API Development): [CMPG-323-Project-2---42563690 ](https://github.com/BonnieSibisi08/CMPG-323-Project-2---42563690)  
- Project 3 (Patterns & Standards): [CMPG-323-Project-3---42563690 ](https://github.com/BonnieSibisi08/CMPG-323-Project-3---42563690)   
- Project 4 (RPA & Testing): [CMPG-323-Project-4---42563690 ](https://github.com/BonnieSibisi08/CMPG-323-Project-4---42563690)   
- Project 5 (Reporting & Monitoring): [CMPG-323-Project-5---42563690 ](https://github.com/BonnieSibisi08/CMPG-323-Project-5---42563690)   

The diagram below shows how all repositories will be linked to the Kanban Guide project. This is how I will my work will be structrured through out the semester.

### Branching Strategy
As these are individual projects, the branching strategy I have decided to use is the Github Flow. Although it does have its disadvantages but there are reasons for choosing this strategy.  
- This strategy allows quick recovery of issues, if there is an error with a release you can quickly rollback to the previous one.  
- Since the code deployed is way less, it eliminates a lot of errors.  
- This strategy is particularly effective for small teams/indivudual projects. Since this is an individual project it will work perfectly, this can be a drawback if you have a big team as it will be hard to keep everyone on the same page all the time.

The diagram below depicts the branching strategy to be used throughout the project.

### Importance of Gitignore's
Gitignore files are crucial for a few reasons:

1. **Keeps Unnecessary Files Out**: They stop unnecessary files, like temporary files and local settings, from being tracked by Git. This keeps the repository clean and focused on the important source code and files.
2. **Manages Repository Size**: By leaving out large and unnecessary files, the .gitignore file helps keep the repository size manageable, which boosts Git's performance and efficiency.
3. **Enhances Security**: Sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and personal data can be kept out of the repository, preventing accidental leaks of confidential info.
4. **Enhances Teamwork**: In group projects, gitignore files ensure only the necessary files are shared among team members, preventing any confusion.
5. **Simplifies Workflow**: When developing, you can work locally without worrying about accidentally committing unwanted files, allowing you to focus on coding and other important tasks.
